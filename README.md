The use of cyclone preheater is to seperate the hot gas from the cyclone. This helps in reducing the heat consumption of clinker production. 

Objective: 
The main goal is to highlight the time periods of abnormality observed during cyclone preheater operation. 

Data Description: 
  There are 6 variables and 370k records. Data is recorded once every 5 minutes over a duration of 3 years.
  1.	Cyclone_Inlet_Gas_Temp – Temperature of Hot gas entering the cyclone.
  2.	Cyclone_Gas_Outlet_Temp – Temperature of Hot gas leaving the cyclone.
  3.	Cyclone_Outlet_Gas_draft – Draft (pressure) of gas at outlet of cyclone.
  4.	Cyclone_cone_draft – Draft (pressure) of gas at cone section of cyclone.
  5.	Cyclone_Material_Temp – Temperature of the material at the outlet of the cyclone.
  6.	Cyclone_Inlet_Draft - Draft (pressure ) of gas at inlet of cyclone.
